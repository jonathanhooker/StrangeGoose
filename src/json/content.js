            description:"In Slacksville\’s Worst Superheroes, Officer John Cop is stumped in trying to \
            nab the culprit known as Peep, who has been pilfering Slacksville’s citizens along with his \
            criminal gang. Interviewed by a TV reporter, Officer Cop makes a plea for villagers to be heroes \
            by reporting anything unusual. Instead, the reporter broadcasts a call to action for all “superheroes” \
            to step up, opening the gates for all types of wannabes to come out of the woodwork to flex their…erm…talents.\
            <br/><br/>\
            What ensues is a hilarious display of self-appointed superheroes “helping”—or more accurately \
            not—Slacksville to be safe from pilfering and peril. Whether it’s due to “Samsonman” who is no \
            stranger to self-confidence, “Cowman” (who is decidedly not a cowboy), The Mom (using her trusty \
            countdown, of course) or other self-taught amateurs, Officer Cop’s patience is running thin. \
            He devises a plan where all the superhero misfits work together, and allowing a true young \
            superhero to shine, to lay a trap for the crime gang and save Slacksville.\
            <br/><br/>\
            Reminiscent of funny favorites including The Adventures of Captain Underpants, the Wayside \
            School series, and My Weird School, Slacksville’s Worst Superheroes has playful line art \
            illustrations throughout that complement author K. Peach’s clever and humorous writing, \
            together creating an imaginative and amusing story that families and educators of young children \
            will enjoy with the young readers in their lives.",

            your mother, don't talk to strangers, and don't look in the mirror.\
